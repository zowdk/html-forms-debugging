# Debugging HTML Forms Practice

In this practice you will be debugging the provided HTML Form.

Your main focus is to practice identify and debug the HTML form. There are some
errors that are obvious while others take more attention.

## Phase 1: Debug the HTML Form

Once you have downloaded the starter, open the __index.html__ file in your
browser.

## Phase 2: Add Last Name

1. The last name field is broken and is not rendering properly.  Please fix it.
- Hint: should be similar to the first name `<div>`

## Phase 3: Adding values

The `<select>` element has a broken dropdown with the following three values:
1. admin
2. user
3. guest

However, upon further inspection the values are not being shown.
Debug the issue.

## Phase 4: Debug the Bio

1. Instead of the bio element having two input fields change it to be able to
take in a text box that allows multiple lines of text.
